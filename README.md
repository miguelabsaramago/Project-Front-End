<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp">How to SlideShow</a>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A description of the event (can be Lipsum, but it always looks nicer with real text)</li>
<li>The current weather in the city</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to show the current weather of the event location</h3>
<li>You can fetch the current weather (including an icon) of the event location using the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeatherMap API</a></li>
<li>Show it as part of the information of selected event location</li>

<h3>Add new event location page for the season 2026</h3>
<li>A form to add new locations</li>
<li>You can experiment with the various input elements, e.g. <code>&lt;input type="date" /&gt;</code> or <code><textarea></code></li>
<li>The form does not need to be functional but when clicking submit a preview of the inserted data should be shown in the console log</li>



<h3>The Owner page</h3>
<li>A page to showcase the author of the event guide</li>
<li>Be as creative as you want :)</li>


<h2>Bonus tasks</h2>
<h3>JSON</h3>
<li>Create your own JSON file with all the blog data in the form of a Mock API</li>

<h3>Forecast</h3>
<li>Add the forecast for the next few days in the detail section of a event location</li>

<h3>Map</h3>
<li>So far, we have not played around with embedding a Map. If you want to, feel free to play around with a Map API and how to integrate it in your app. You could then show the event location on a map for every event location.</li>
<li>Feel free to use any Map APIs like Google Maps or MapBox</li>

<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview?hl=pt-br">Google Maps API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a> I reccomend this one for easiness and good documentation</li>


<h2>Considerations</h2>
<li>The mockups provided are for example only, feel free to design/structure your site as you see fit;</li>
<li>Have responsiveness in mind, do your best to make your website look good in both Desktop and Mobile browsers;</li>
<li>When starting to implement, focus on creating the HTML and CSS first, JS becomes much simpler when you already have an UI to code for;</li>
<li>Style your website at will, feel free to use a CSS framework like Tailwind, Bulma or Bootstrap;</li>
<li>Use Wouter as the routing framework for React</li>
<li>You are allowed (and even encouraged) to ask your classmates for help or help them;</li>
<li>You can ask the teacher for support at any time</li>
